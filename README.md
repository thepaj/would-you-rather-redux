This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This is a Would-you-rather game app made with React and Redux. The app allows the user to add a question and then vote on questions that they and other users added. When voted the user sees what percentage of users voted the same as them.

To install the project:

    install all project dependencies with npm install
    start the development server with npm start
